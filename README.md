This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Grade-Tracker

This app was created to help students who have difficulty planning which courses to dedicate their time to. Its primary function is to help track GPA scores throughout a student's program. Currently, it can keep track of the prerequisite and corequisite courses, as well as find courses matching certain grade criteria. I plan to add several features to it soon including, the ability to track CGPA's up to a specified term and provide course recommendations given their prerequisite/corequisite courses.
(Screenshots below)


#### To-do (Features Not Yet Implemented)

-   [ ] Track CGPA's up to a certain term
-   [ ] Analyze the courses to find which course a student will need help in based on prereq
-   [ ] Make it easier to see which term a course belongs to if there are many courses in a specific term

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
