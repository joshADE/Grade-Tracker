# Grade-Tracker

This app is designed to aid students when managing their courses. It primarily functions as a record keeper to help in tracking the GPA scores throughout a student’s program. Some of its other features include keeping track of the prerequisite and corequisite courses and finding courses matching certain grade criteria. I plan to add several more features to it soon including providing course recommendations using the course prerequisite/corequisite courses. (Screenshots below)


#### To-do

-   [X] Track CGPA’s up to a certain term
-   [ ] Provide course recommendations
-   [ ] Add support for grade conversion of more schools
